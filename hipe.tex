\chapter{Многословное отступление: Игра HIPE}

You could leave it out, or keep it in English,
but the best option would be to redo the game
in Russian! To do that, I'd suggest getting a good
computer wordlist (e.g., a list of Scrabble-eligible
Russian words), and write a program that checks
for rare substrings.
Then pick out the ones that are particularly clever or amusing, and you'll have
a great list of Russian HIPEs. 

Of course it is possible that, since spelling in
Russian is more reliable than in English, the game of
HIPE doesn't work as well in Russian.
But why not
give it a try?
